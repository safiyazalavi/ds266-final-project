Abstract
Biotechnology stock prices often exhibit sharp and sudden movements following clinical or regulatory announcements, yet predicting these reactions remains challenging because market responses frequently diverge from the apparent sentiment of the press release. This work develops a two-stage framework that integrates Named Entity Recognition using BioBERT, a domain-adapted NLP model, with an XGBoost classifier trained on financial indicators and NER-derived event features to predict five-day stock-movement classes. The BioBERT NER model achieved an entity-level F1 score of 0.22 with over 60\% event-level label accuracy, and the final XGBoost classifier demonstrated strong precision in identifying large drops (0.67) and large increases (0.60), indicating its ability to reasonably detect high-impact events. Feature-importance analysis showed that financial indicators, along with negative regulatory and efficacy events, were the strongest predictors of market movement, demonstrating the value of combining event-specific NLP features with financial data to model biotech market reactions.
